# Decisiontree-vs-Randomforest
I did an experiment on real dataset from LendingClub.com to do exploratory data analysis and predictive analysis using Random forest and decision tree algorithms to find which one had better precision.
Skills used- Predictive analysis, Feature engineering, Exploratory data analysis
Result- Random forest performs better then decision tree algorithm due to its ensemble way of predicting using multiple decision trees.
